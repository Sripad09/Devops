cd maven4

3) Package the newly created project by executing the following command
mvn package

You will get an error because of java version on executing the above command.
For that,

4) Open pom.xml and type the following code (after version tag (or) after
name tag)
<properties>
<maven.compiler.source>7</maven.compiler.source>
<maven.compiler.target>1.7</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>

5) Again package the project using the command
mvn package

6) See the list of options that can be used with git by typing
git

7) Add your email by executing the following command
git config --global user.email “Your Github email”

8) Add your name by executing the following command
git config --global user.name “Your Github username”

9) Initialize the Git repository by executing the following command
git init

10) Add pom.xml file by executing the following command
git add pom.xml

11) Add the source folder by executing the following command
git add src

12) Generate one SSH key by executing the following command

16) Set push to Github for saving code to Github repository
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true

17) Set the branch to main
git branch -M main

18) Push the code to Github repository

git pull --rebase origin main

20) Again execute Step# 18

21) In case you executed Step #15 more than once, then execute the command

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Your Github username>/<Your
repository name> and execute the commands from Step# 16 to Step #20

executing the command

gedit t.jar (and enter any character. Then, save and close the file)

25) Select Pipeline and click on Ok

26) Scroll down and enter the pipeline script in the textarea as shown below

pipeline
{
agent any
stages
{
stage(“Checkout”)
{
steps
{
git branch: ‘main’, url : ‘<Your github url which ends with .git>’
}
}

stage(“Build”)
{
steps
{
sh ‘mvn clean package’
}
}

stage(“Test”)
{
steps
{
sh ‘mvn test’
}
}

stage(“Archive Artifacts”)
{
steps
{
archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', allowEmptyArchive: true
}
}

stage(“Deploy”)
{
steps
{
sh “””
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False

ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini mydeploy.yml --extra-
vars='ansible_become_pass=exam@cse'

“””
}
}
}
}

and click on Save

27) Create an inventory file hosts.ini by executing the following command
sudo gedit /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<Your pipeline name>/hosts.ini

Source code :

[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local

Save and close the file

28) Create a playbook mydeploy.yml by executing the following command
sudo gedit /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<Your pipeline name>/mydeploy.yml

Source code :
---
- name: Deploy Artifact to Localhost
hosts: localhost
tasks:
- name: Copy the artifact to the target location
become: true
become_user: student
become_method: su
copy:
src: "/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/< Your pipeline
name>/target/<Your Maven project name>-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
dest: "/home/student/t.jar"

Save and close the file

29) Click on Build now
- If you get a green tick, it means Build is successful else if you get a red
cross mark, it means Build has failed. You will have to type the correct
